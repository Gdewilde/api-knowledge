- name: APIs You Won't Hate
  description: API development is a topic very close to Phil's heart. APIs You Won't Hate started out as a book, with Phil pouring everything API related he knew, all the problems he faced, all the design decisions he wish he thought about earlier. Since the book, Phil has continued to learn and grow, thanks to new experiences, and new conversations with really smart people. Learning never stops, and the Slack channel that grew from the book subscribers and their friends has become home to the largest API chat group on the internet.

- name: API Handyman
  description: Hi! I’m Arnaud Lauret, the API Handyman and author of The Design of Web APIs. I like to share what I do, struggle with, learn, and teach while working in the API space. I have been working in the financial industry for 18 years and my job was always around connecting pieces of software together, hence creating and using web services or APIs. My current daily job is helping people, from executive to developers and everything in between, to understand what are APIs, why they matters and how to do them. I also help dozens of different teams to design their APIs by reviewing and challenging their designs, training them to design API and also building API design guidelines.

- name: SmartAPI
  description: The SmartAPI project aims to maximize the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of web-based Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Rich metadata is essential to properly describe your API so that it becomes discoverable, connected, and reusable. We have developed a openAPI-based specification for defining the key API metadata elements and value sets. SmartAPI's leverage the Open API specification v3 and JSON-LD for providing semantically annotated JSON content that can be treated as Linked Data.
